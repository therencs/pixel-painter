# pixel-painter
This Javascript project allows you to select colors and draw with them on a blocky canvas.
I used this project to get familiar with a multitude of different concepts. Those concepts being, the DOM (Document Object Model), 
connecting JS files together to improve readability, and event listeners. For this project, I am most proud of the selection swap. 
To elaborate, you are given two colours in the colour selector (located in the middle of the header). The primary colour is the one
that gets utilized to paint on the canvas with. However, you can store an extra colour in the secondary colour box. You can alternate
primary and secondary colours with ease by pressing 'x' or by pressing the small white button. 

THINGS TO DO:

- Add a fill tool
- Add undo, redo, and undo history
- Add an eraser
- Add custom colour tool
- Improve UI
